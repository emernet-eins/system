<h2>Fixing a typo / grammar / formatting / etc.</h2>
This kind of work is very important, too! It helps to provide an easily understandable
and clean codebase.

To help us, please:

- fork this repository
- create a new branch in your fork (please give it an explanatory name)
- do your changes in your branch and push them to your branch
- open a pull request

If your changes pass our review (basically just proof-reading, don't worry ðŸ˜‰), we will soon merge your changes!

<h2>Adding a new component</h2>
Our code is organized in components to avoid cluttered markup and provide better reusability.

To add a knew component, please:

- fork this repository
- create a new branch in your fork (please give it an explanatory name)
- create your component (details below)

There's a folder called `templates`. In this folder, you can find various boiler plates, also one for a new component.

Copy the component boiler plate file to the components folder. Inside the components folder, create a new folder with your components name. Move the boiler plate file into that new directory. Also please rename the boiler plate file to fit the components name.

Now you can adjust the boiler plate file and implement your component.

After you're done with that, don't forget to actually register your component.
To do that, open the file `component-registration.js` inside the `/src/js/` directory.

There, you need to import your component like this:

```js
import AppYourComponent from '../../components/your-component/your-component.js';
```

To the `components` array, add a new helper-object:

```js
const components = [
  {
    componentName: 'app-something-already-existing',
    class: AppSomethingAlreadyExisting
  },
  // Your new component below
  {
    componentName: 'app-your-component',
    class: AppYourComponent
  }
];
```

Mind that `componentName` needs to be a string and start with `'app-'`. Also, `class` is not a string but your previously importet component.

Good job! Now you're ready to use your component everywhere in the project with the tag you specified with `componentName: 'app-your-component'` above:

```html
<app-your-component></app-your-component>
```

Now, just commit and push your changes to your forked repository and create a pull request!

<p id="add-country">
<h2>Add a country</h2>

EMERNET is split up by countries. Here's a step-by-step guide about how to add a new one.

- fork this repository
- create a branch in your fork (please give it a descriptive name like "add bla-bla-land")

Now, you can add the pages of the country you want to add.
Countries consist of three pages:

- index.html
- numbers.html
- about.html

So to add a country, create a sub-directory in `pages`, named like the country code of the country you want to add (us for USA, de for Germany, en for United Kindom, you get the idea).

From the `templates` folder, copy the index.html, about.html, and numbers.html to your new country directory. Translate the template pages to the country's language, and adjust the numbers.html page by changing, adding, and removing numbers. Also, don't forget to add the new country to the header! To do that, open `/components/header/header.js` and add a new link to the dropdown menu in the component's markup.

Also, please adjust the links in each header in index.html, about.html, and numbers.html.
When dealing with links, please use the whole path e. g. `/pages/country/index.html`.

That's it! Now commit and push your changes, then simply create a pull request. If you have a source for the numbers you added, please include it in the pull request.

After it got reviewed (basically just proof-reading and having a look at the links), your pull request will get merged.
