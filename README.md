  <h1>EMERNET E.I.N.S - system</h1>
  <p>
    EMERNET E.I.N.S (Emergency Information Network System) was created to provide important information in case of a complete communication network failure.
    EMERNET provides information like important Telephone numbers, emergency news applications (ex. NINA) and emergency services (ex. shelter locations).
    All information provided is managed by the Open Source Community on GitHub and EMERNET-EINS.org.
    EMERNET is frequently updated to provide the latest information.

This repository hosts the frontend for EMERNET. It holds emergency numbers for different countries across the whole world.

### Installing EMERNET System

If you want to host your own instance of emernet, you have two options:

- run the installer provided <a href="https://github.com/emernet-eins/server/releases">here</a>. This will
  - install Apache2
  - install unzip
  - **remove Apache's 000-default.conf file, and replace it with emernet.conf**
  - download this repository and move it to `/var/www/emernet/`
  - set owner rights of `/var/www/emernet/` to www-data:www-data

or

- download and install EMERNET yourself:
  - download this repository to your webserver and place it in its respective document root directory
  - create a virtual host file
  - configure emernet to be reachable (<a href="https://github.com/emernet-eins/server/blob/master/emernet.conf">example Apache2 config</a>)

If you don't have any webserver installed, option one is recommended. If you already have a webserver installed, maybe also configured it, option two is what you want.



<h2 align="center" id="updating">Updating</h2>

If you installed EMERNET via the installer, it should automatically update itself if you didn't terminate the .jar file. If you did or want to trigger the update by yourself, simply run <a href="https://github.com/emernet-eins/server/releases/">emernet_runtime_version.jar</a> again.

If you installed EMERNET by hand, you can simply download the latest <a href="https://github.com/emernet-eins/system/releases">release</a> and override it with the contents of your webserver.

<h2 align="center" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

As mentioned above, EMERNET E.I.N.S is a system that provides emergency information in case of an emergency.

**What is being provided?**

* Important numbers for multiple countries
* Automatically updated files
* Direct call links

### Browser Compatibility

EMERNET E.I.N.S works in pretty much every browser. Even mobile browsers are able to use the links provided.

<h2 align="center" id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

### Intent and purpose

We created this project to provide the really important information everybody could need in an emergency. We know that there are enough other ways to get to his information, but we are planning big for this project.

### Future

We are planning to extend this project into a raspberry Pi only version, that even installs everything required for a WiFi hotspot, so everybody can access the information by just connecting to the open WiFi.

### Monetization

We are not really planning to monetize this project. The information provided is free to be viewed to everybody. However, if you would like to buy us a coffee, feel free to do so.


<h2 align="center" id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

**We want contributing to EMERNET E.I.N.S to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** Due to our project being split into multiple parts, there is more than one repository on our organization.
